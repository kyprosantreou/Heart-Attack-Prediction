# Heart Attack Prediction Program
This Python program provides a user-friendly menu to select and run different machine learning models on a heart attack dataset. The available models include Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes. Additionally, the program allows the user to execute all the models in sequence.

## Features

- **Model Selection:** Choose from Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), or Naive Bayes.
- **All Models Option:** Run all the available models sequentially.
- **Interactive Menu:** User-friendly selection menu with error handling for invalid inputs.
- **Data Handling:** Loads data from a CSV file and applies the selected machine learning model.
